This repository contains the code for the paper:

  Prasse, B. and P. Van Mieghem, 2022, "Predicting network dynamics without requiring the knowledge of the interaction graph", 
  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Vol. 119, No. 44, e2205517119. (DOI pnas.2205517119)

The main functionality of this code is to reproduce the figures in the paper. Hence, instead of a single main file, there are multiple
Fig_*.mat files which can be run directly to reproduce the corresponding figure(s) in the paper. Please see my comments in the code
for more information.

A good starting point could be to run and inspect the output of:

Fig_3_S5_S6_S7_S8( 1, 100, 200 )

The first argument is the random seed=1, the second argument specifies N=100 nodes, and the third arguments specifies n=200 observations.
